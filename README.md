If your printer is capable of only DIN-A3 (DIN-A4) you can get DIN-A2 (DIN-A3) too, by dividing the calendar into 2 pieces and glue the pieces togehter after printing them  
How to do it? do the following: 
1. select LastDecember, select month from January to June, and print to DIN-A3 (DIN-A4) in Portrait-format
1. select NextJanuary, select month from July to December, and print to DIN-A3 (DIN-A4) in Portrait-format
